I am currently on a learning adventure with Topmentor, specializing in Masters Data Science. Here, I not only delve into various data analysis techniques and implement Machine Learning algorithms but also actively contribute to real-world projects. In a recent project, I utilized my skills in database management with MySQL to ensure efficient data handling, and leveraged the power of Tableau for intuitive data visualization, creating impactful dashboards for insightful decision-making. My ability to seamlessly integrate data from diverse sources and present it coherently sets me apart.
